Of course. This is an excellent decision. Migrating to React Native with Expo will provide a robust, modern, and highly scalable foundation for the Tafuta App. The choice of Expo, in particular, will significantly accelerate development, simplify the build process, and manage native dependencies effectively.

Here is a comprehensive project roadmap and timeline for migrating the Tafuta App to React Native, using your specified tech stack.

---

### **Project Overview: Tafuta App Migration to React Native**

**Goal:** To migrate the existing native Android (Java) and iOS (Swift) Tafuta app into a single, unified codebase using React Native and Expo. The new application will achieve feature parity with the existing apps and be architected for rapid scalability to include future enhancements like AI, ticketing, and payments.

**Core Technology Stack:**
*   **Framework:** React Native with Expo
*   **Navigation:** Expo Router (File-based routing)
*   **Styling:** React Native Stylesheet (with a potential for a global theme/token system)
*   **Animation:** React Native Animated API
*   **Language:** JavaScript / TypeScript (TypeScript is highly recommended for scalability)
*   **State Management:** React Context API (for simplicity) or Redux/Zustand (for complexity)
*   **Development Methodology:** Agile - SCRUM

### **Project Roadmap**

The project is broken down into four distinct phases, designed to be executed incrementally using SCRUM sprints.

#### **Phase 0: Foundation & Setup (Sprint 0)**
*Objective: Prepare the development environment, project structure, and foundational elements before feature development begins.*

1.  **Project Initialization:**
    *   Set up the new project using `create-expo-app`.
    *   Initialize a Git repository and establish branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow).
2.  **Project Structuring:**
    *   Define a scalable folder structure (e.g., `app`, `components`, `hooks`, `constants`, `assets`, `lib`).
    *   Configure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript for code quality and consistency.
3.  **Navigation Setup:**
    *   Integrate **Expo Router**.
    *   Create a basic app layout with a tab navigator and a stack navigator for initial screens (e.g., Home, Scanner, Profile).
4.  **UI/UX Foundation:**
    *   Establish a global theme file for colors, fonts, spacing, and other design tokens.
    *   Create a set of basic, reusable UI components (e.g., Button, TextInput, Card, Header).
    *   Use **React Native Stylesheet** for all component styling.
5.  **Environment Setup:**
    *   Set up environment variables for API keys (Google Maps, etc.) using `.env` files.

#### **Phase 1: Core Feature Parity (Sprints 1-5)**
*Objective: Re-implement the critical features of the existing Tafuta app. Each major feature can be a sprint's focus.*

1.  **User Authentication & Profiles:**
    *   Implement login, registration, and logout flows.
    *   Securely store authentication tokens (using `expo-secure-store`).
    *   Build the user profile screen.
2.  **Scanner Integration (QR & Barcode):**
    *   Integrate `expo-camera` to build the scanner screen.
    *   Implement the `onBarCodeScanned` callback to handle data from QR codes and barcodes.
    *   Develop the UI overlay for the scanner (e.g., viewfinder box, instructions).
3.  **Camera Functionality:**
    *   Use `expo-camera` to allow users to take pictures.
    *   Integrate `expo-image-picker` to allow users to select images from their device's gallery.
    *   Manage camera permissions gracefully.
4.  **Google Maps & GPS Integration:**
    *   Integrate `react-native-maps`.
    *   Configure Google Maps API keys for both Android and iOS within the Expo project.
    *   Implement core map features:
        *   Displaying the map centered on the user's current location (using `expo-location`).
        *   Placing markers on the map.
        *   Handling user interactions with the map (zoom, pan, marker press).

#### **Phase 2: UI/UX Polish & Enhancements (Sprints 6-7)**
*Objective: Refine the user experience, add animations, and ensure the app feels modern and responsive.*

1.  **UI Replication and Refinement:**
    *   Ensure all screens and components from the original app are faithfully recreated and feel native to each platform.
2.  **Animations:**
    *   Use **React Native Animated** to add meaningful transitions and micro-interactions.
    *   Implement loading indicators, screen transitions, and interactive element feedback.
3.  **Push Notifications:**
    *   Integrate `expo-notifications` to handle receiving and displaying push notifications.
4.  **Accessibility (a11y):**
    *   Ensure the app is usable for people with disabilities by adding appropriate labels, roles, and states to components.

#### **Phase 3: Testing, Deployment & Launch (Sprints 8-9)**
*Objective: Thoroughly test the application, prepare for release, and deploy to the app stores.*

1.  **Testing:**
    *   **Unit/Component Testing:** Write tests for critical components and utility functions using Jest and React Native Testing Library.
    *   **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Manually test all user flows on physical Android and iOS devices.
    *   **Beta Testing:** Use Expo's EAS (Expo Application Services) to create builds for internal testing and distribute via TestFlight (iOS) and Google Play Internal Testing (Android).
2.  **Build and Deployment:**
    *   Configure app icons, splash screens, and other metadata.
    *   Use **EAS Build** to create production-ready `.apk`/`.aab` (Android) and `.ipa` (iOS) files.
    *   Use **EAS Submit** to upload the builds to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
3.  **Analytics and Crash Reporting:**
    *   Integrate a service like Sentry or Bugsnag for crash reporting.
    *   Set up basic analytics to monitor user engagement.

### **Key Considerations for Success**

*   **TypeScript:** Adopting TypeScript from the start will be invaluable for a project intended to scale. It prevents common errors and makes the codebase easier to maintain.
*   **State Management:** Start with React Context for simplicity. If app state becomes complex (e.g., with ticketing and payments), plan a migration to a more robust solution like Redux Toolkit or Zustand.
*   **API Contracts:** Work closely with the backend team to ensure the API endpoints needed for the new app are ready and documented. The migration is a great opportunity to refactor or improve existing APIs.
*   **Existing User Data:** Plan how existing user data will be handled. The simplest path is ensuring the new app authenticates against the same user database, so users can log in with their existing credentials.

This roadmap provides a clear, incremental path to successfully migrating the Tafuta App to a modern, scalable React Native platform. By following the SCRUM methodology, your team can remain agile, respond to challenges, and deliver value consistently throughout the project.
